# First php project

This is our first individual assignment, the purpose was to create a PHP applicationa of our choice using HTML, CSS and PHP. I decided to create a music page for a band called Gunno, a yet not very well known band. It includes album covers, link to upcoming music and a made upp concert.
Link to my one.com:http://johjon.com/first-project/

# The project uses the following functionality

    Variables
    Multiple data types
    Arrays
    Functions
    Loops
    Multiple files (require)
    Output (echo, print etc.)

# Installation

In order to do this you need to have php on your computer. To find my repositry on Github search for JonssonJohanna.https://github.com/JonssonJohanna/first-project

1. clone the repository so that you can access the files on your computer and open them in your code editor.
2. Open your terminal, 'command' + 'j'.
3. Write `php -S localhost:8000` in the terminal.
4. Open localhost:8000 in the url and add `/index.php`at the end of the url.
5. When you have done that you have access to the project.

# Code Review

Code review written by [Anton Marinov](https://github.com/antmar0417).

1. `index.php:14-61` - You can use a short echo tag "<?= ?>" for optimising your code.
2. `functions.php:13` - You can skip the comment "Built-in Function for date" as we already know that is a built-in function.
3. `functions.php:7` - You have a comma sign after the variable name.
4. `style.css:35` - Remember to use your color variable var(--font-color) on line 35, 67 and 117.
5. `-` - This site is not desktop optimised. For example, you can show more pictures in each row.
