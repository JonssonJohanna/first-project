# First php project

This is our first individual assignment, the purpose was to create a website of our choice with php, css and html. I decided to create a music page for a band called Gunno, a yet not very well known band. It includes album covers, link to upcoming music and a made upp concert.
Link to my one.com:http://johjon.com/first-project/

# The project uses the following functionality

    Variables
    Multiple data types
    Arrays
    Functions
    Loops
    Multiple files (require)
    Output (echo, print etc.)

# Installation

In order to do this you need to have php on your computer. To find my repositry on Github search for JonssonJohanna.

1. clone the repository so that you can access the files on your computer and open them in your code editor.
2. Open your terminal, 'command' + 'j'.
3. Write `php -S localhost:8000` in the terminal.
4. Open localhost:8000 in the url and add `/index.php`at the end of the url.
5. When you have done that you have access to the project.
